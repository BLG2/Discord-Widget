## 👤 User Widgets

Each user who connects with my bot gets a personal widget, featuring:

- ✅ Username & avatar  
- 💬 Status (Online / DND / Idle / Offline)  
- 🎮 Activity (like games, Spotify, etc.)  
- 🎨 Choose from 6 beautiful themes  
- 🖼️ Upload a custom background  
- 👻 Hide specific elements (e.g. status, activity, etc.)  
- 🔄 Always live and auto-updated  
- 🔧 And much more!

> ℹ️ **Note:** User widgets work only when the bot shares a server with the user.  
> This can be done by inviting the bot to your own server, or by joining the support & widget server — available via the [website](https://atombot.be/).

> 🔧 User widgets can be managed and customized via the [dashboard](https://atombot.be/)
